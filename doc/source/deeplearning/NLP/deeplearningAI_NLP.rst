3.课程介绍
--------------------------------

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human 
    language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. 
    As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building 
    models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce 
    insights from text and audio.

    By the end of this Specialization, you will be ready to design NLP applications that 
    perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages 
    and summarize text, and even build chatbots. These and other NLP applications are going 
    to be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.

    This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, 
    and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University 
    who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. Łukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research 
    Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax 
    libraries, and the Transformer paper.
