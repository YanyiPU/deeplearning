NLP with Classification and Vector Spaces
=============================================

课程信息
---------------

In Course 1 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will:

a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then naïve Bayes, 
b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the 
   dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
c) Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word 
   embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.
 
Please make sure that you’re comfortable programming in Python and have a basic knowledge of machine learning, 
matrix multiplications, and conditional probability.

By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering(问答系统)
and sentiment analysis(情感分析), created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot!

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. 
Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the 
Deep Learning Specialization. Łukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of 
Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.
